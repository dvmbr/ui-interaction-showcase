# UI Interaction Showcase

A portfolio project built with **Vue 3** that focuses on  
**state-driven UI interactions and component architecture**, rather than visual styling alone.

This project demonstrates how **user actions, async flows, and UI feedback**  
can be composed into predictable and reusable interaction patterns.

---

## Overview

UI Interaction Showcase is a **practical playground**, not a UI library.

Instead of collecting many unrelated components,  
this project dives deep into **one interaction flow** and explores:

- where state should live
- how components communicate
- how loading, success, error, and rollback states are expressed in UI
- how interaction logic can be separated from presentation

The goal is to showcase **frontend implementation and state management skills**.
